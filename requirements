NOTE:
you will need to add the following to the pyfluidsynth.py, which is likely to
be found in /home/$USER_NAME/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mingus/midi/ :

def pitch_wheel_sens(self, chan, val):
    """Adjust pitch bend amount. Added manually by T. Boziuk
    """
    return fluid_synth_pitch_wheel_sens(self.synth, chan, val)

and

fluid_synth_pitch_wheel_sens = cfunc(
"fluid_synth_pitch_wheel_sens",
c_int,
("synth", c_void_p, 1),
("chan", c_int, 1),
("val", c_int, 1),
)

in the appropriate spots.
